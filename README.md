# UFOs (The Truth is out there)
---

**Summary**
---

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, I added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

This new assignment consists of one technical analysis deliverable and a written report. You will submit the following deliverables:

-Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
-Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)
